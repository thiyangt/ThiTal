# Permutation Tests

- Permutation tests are useful when we do not know the distribution of a test statistic under null hypothesis.

- Gives a simple way to compute sampling distribution under null hypothesis.


- Generate data under null hypothesis. How?

    - **shuffle** or **permute the observed data** (e.g., by assigning different outcome values to each observation from among the set of actually observed values.)

- Permutation tests cannot solve all problems: they are valid only
when the null hypothesis is ‘there is no association...’
