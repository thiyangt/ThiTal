There are a variety of different ways that data leaks can occur with time series data. For example: i) randomly chosen blocks of time series are concatenated to form a new time series, ii) scale-shifts, iii) repeating patterns in time series, iv) white noise is added in the original time series to form a new time series, etc. This work introduces a novel tool to detect these data leaks.

Think of Statistics as building blocks, and you need a solid foundation to move forward. Here, I explain five common terms in Statistics: i) Parameter, ii) Statistic, iii) Random Variable, iv) Estimator, v) Estimate and their notations.\nI will start with the definition of Population and Sample.\nA population is a complete collection of individuals/ objects that we are interested in. A sample is a subset of a population.\nParameter A parameter is a descriptive measure(numerical value) of the population. Parameters are usually denoted by Greek letters.\nExamples of parameters:\n \\(\\mu\\) - population mean\n  \\(\\sigma^2\\) - population variance\n  Statistic A statistic is a descriptive measure of a sample. For example, sample mean, sample standard deviation, etc. We will talk about the notations under estimator and estimate.\n Random Variable Before introducing random variable, let me very shortly recall what is a random experiment and what is a sample space.\nA random experiment is a physical situation whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty until it is observed. A random experiment can be repeated as many times as we want under the same conditions (leading to different outcomes). Each one of them a trial. Thus, a trial is a particular performance of a random experiment.\nA Sample space is a set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. In this blog post I use \\(\\Omega\\) to denote a sample space.\nExample 1:\nRandom Experiment: Tossing of a coin.\nSample Space: \\(\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}\\)\nlibrary(prob) tosscoin(1)  toss1 1 H 2 T Example 2:\nRandom Experiment: Toss a coin three times.\nSample Space: \\(\\Omega = \\{(H, H, H), (H, H, T), (H, T, H), (T, H, H), (H, T, T), (T, H, T), (T, T, H), (T, T, T)\\}\\)\ntosscoin(3)  toss1 toss2 toss3 1 H H H 2 T H H 3 H T H 4 T T H 5 H H T 6 T H T 7 H T T 8 T T T Definition: Random Variable\nLet \\((\\Omega, \\mathscr{F}, \\mathbb{P})\\) be a probability space. Random variable is a function \\(X: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(\\forall B \\in \\mathcal{B}( \\mathbb{R} ): X^{-1}(B) \\in \\mathscr{F}\\).\nYou need Measure Theory knowledge to understand the above definition.\nLoosely speaking a Random variable is a function from the sample space to the real numbers. There are two types of random variables: i) Discrete random variable and ii) Continuous random variable. We use Roman capital letters to denote random variables (\\(X\\), \\(Y\\), \\(Z\\), \\(U\\), \\(T\\), etc.). However, as soon as a variable \\(X\\) is observed, the observed values are represented by the corresponding simple Roman letter.\nThe notation \\(X(\\omega)\\) denotes the numerical value of the random variable X, when the outcome of the experiment is some particular \\(\\omega\\).\nAn example will help you to understand how this works. To start with, let’s consider a simple experiment with two possible outcomes: PCR test result of a randomly selected individual.\nThe random variable \\(X\\) can be defined as follows:\nSolution 1.1\nSample space\n\\[\\Omega = \\{Positive, Negative\\}\\]\nRandom variable\n\\[ X(\\omega)= \\begin{cases} 0,\u0026amp; \\text{if } \\omega = Negative\\\\ 1, \u0026amp; \\text{if } \\omega = Positive \\end{cases} \\]\nSolution 1.2\nSimply drop \\(\\omega\\) and define the random variable as follows:\n\\[ X= \\begin{cases} 0,\u0026amp; \\text{if the test result is negative. } \\\\ 1, \u0026amp; \\text{if the test result is positive.} \\end{cases} \\]\nLet’s consider another experiment. The experiment consists in selecting a random undergraduate student in the University during a period of one week, and measuring their height.\nThe random variable \\(Y\\) can be defined as follows:\n\\[\\Omega = \\{ \\omega: \\omega \u0026gt; 0\\}\\]\n\\[Y(\\omega) = \\omega, \\text{ } \\omega \\in \\Omega. \\]\nor\n\\[Y = \\text{Height in cm.}\\]\n Notations for Random Variables and Observed Data (in Sampling) Suppose you have a random variable \\(X\\). Suppose we repeat the random experiment \\(n\\) times. Then the resulting random variables are denoted by \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\). All \\(X_i\\)’s have the same distribution as \\(X\\). The random variables \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) are collectively referred to as a random sample.\nLet’s try to understand the concept with an example.\n\\[ X_i= \\begin{cases} 0,\u0026amp; \\text{if the test result of the } i^{th} \\text { is negaive } \\\\ 1, \u0026amp; \\text{if the test result of the } i^{th} \\text { is positive, } \\end{cases} \\]\nwhere \\(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\\)\nWe performed the PCR test on randomly selected 5 individuals. We called this sample 1. The results are \\(x_1=1, x_2=0, x_3=0, x_4=1, x_5=1\\).\nPrior to obtaining \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\), there is uncertainty about the values of each \\(x_i\\). Because of this uncertainty, before the results becomes available we view each observation as a random variable and denote the sample by \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5\\).\nWe again performed the PCR test on another randomly selected 5 individuals. We called this sample 2. Now results are \\(x_1=0, x_2=0, x_3=0, x_4=1, x_5=0\\).\nYou can see observable values for \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5\\) vary from sample to sample.\n Estimator and Estimate Distinction between the terms Estimator and Estimate is important.\nLet \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) be a random sample from a distribution function \\(f_X(x)\\) that depends on a unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\).\nAn estimator is a statistic, \\(T = f(X_1, ..., X_n)\\), that is used to estimate the unknown unknown parameter, \\(\\theta\\), based on an observed sample of \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\). The \\(t=f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\\) is an estimate of \\(\\theta\\).\nEstimator: An estimator is always a random variable.\n\\(\\hat{\\theta} = T = f(X_1, ..., X_n)\\)\nEstimate: An estimate is a constant.\n\\(\\hat{\\theta} = t = f(x_1, ..., x_n)\\)\nNote that we use \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) for both estimator and estimate.\nEstimator is a function of observable random variables that is used to estimate an unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\). The corresponding estimate is obtained by substituting the observed values to the estimator. You can also think of an estimator as the rule (equation) that is used to compute an estimate. For example, the sample mean, \\(\\bar{X}\\), is an estimator that is used to estimate the population mean, \\(\\mu\\).\nBelow example is useful to understand the concepts.\nLet’s say you wanted to know the mean height of undergraduates in a certain university with a population of 1000 undergraduates. You take a random sample of 10 students and measure their height. The observed values are (in cm) 150, 155, 160, 161, 162, 152, 140, 141, 150, 155. Suppose you want to use sample mean to estimate the population mean.\nThe parameter we want to estimate is, \\(\\mu\\), population mean (mean height of the students in the university.).\nThere are infinitely many possible estimators for \\(\\mu\\). For example, sample mean, sample median. In this example we use sample mean to estimate \\(\\mu\\). Now, let’s write the estimator using the notations.\nTo do this, we first define random variables \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, ..., X_{10}\\) as follows: \\(X_1\\) is the height of the \\(1^{st}\\) chosen person, \\(X_2\\) be the height of the \\(2^{nd}\\) chosen person,…. In general, \\(X_i\\) is the height of the \\(i^{th}\\) student chosen from the population.\nNow we can write the estimator as\n\\[\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{X}=\\frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + ... + X_{10}}{10}.\\]\nThe estimate is\n\\[\\hat{\\mu}=152.6\\text{ cm}.\\]\nmean(c(150, 155, 160, 161, 162, 152, 140, 141, 150, 155)) [1] 152.6 If you are not given the observed values of \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, ..., X_{10}\\), you can write the estimate as\n\\[\\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_{10}}{10}.\\]\nThe observed value of the estimator varies from sample to sample.\n Usage Writing distributions  \\[X \\sim Bin(10, 0.6)\\]\n\\[f_X(x) = P(X=x) = {10\\choose x} 0.6^x 0.4^{(10-x)}\\]\n\\[f_X(5) = P(X=5) = {10\\choose 5} 0.6^5 0.4^{(10-5)} = 0.37\\]\npbinom(5, 10, 0.6) [1] 0.3668967 Calculation of expectations  \\[E(\\text{Estimator}) = \\text{Parameter}\\]\n\\[E(\\bar{X}) = \\mu\\]\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\n ","date":1593820800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593820800,"objectID":"28af02174a7bbd23b46a22c223833d3c","permalink":"/post/statterms1/","publishdate":"2020-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/statterms1/","section":"post","summary":"The most common problem while learning Statistics is that students’ lack of understanding of the basic terminologies, notations, definitions and concepts.

The third algorithm use efficient Bayesian multivariate surface regression approach to estimate forecast error for each method, and then using the minimum predicted error to select a forecasting model or to choose individual models for forecast combinations.","tags":null,"title":"Feature-based time series forecasting","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Welcome to Slides Academic\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three  A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let's make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

Thus, the “online” part of our algorithm requires only feature computation, and the application of a single forecasting model, with no need to estimate large numbers of models within a class, or to carry out a computationally-intensive cross-validation procedure.
