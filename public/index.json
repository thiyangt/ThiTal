Providing better forecasts for these time series is important in decision and policy making. However, large scale time series data present numerous challenges in modelling and implementation due to the high dimensionality. It is unlikely that a single method will consistently provide better forecasts across all time series. On the other hand, selecting individual forecast models when the number of series is very large can be extremely challenging. In this talk, I will present a general framework for forecast model selection using meta-learning. We call this framework FFORMS (Feature-based FORecast Model Selection). The underlying approach involves computing a vector of features from the time series which are then used to select the forecasting model. The model selection process is carried out using a classification algorithm – we use the time series features as inputs, and the best forecasting algorithm as the output. Furthermore, we explore what is happening under the hood of the FFORMS framework and thereby gain an understanding of what features lead to the different choices of forecast models and how different features influence the predicted outcome. The proposed algorithm is implemented in the R package seer, which is available on CRAN at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=seer.\nSeer package: https://github.com/thiyangt/seer\n","date":1639094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639094400,"objectID":"5d571a41de6ab39a8e53d22c5cfa933d","permalink":"/talk/whyr-talk/","publishdate":"2021-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/whyr-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"The Why R?

The other method of recognizing these plants involves Laboratory- based testing, which requires trained skills, data interpretation which is costly and time-intensive. Automatic ways to identify medicinal plants are useful especially for those that are lacking experience in herbal recognition. We introduce a computationally efficient new algorithm for medicinal plant classification. We refer to our medicinal plant classification algorithm as MEDIPI : MEDIicinal Plant Identification. MEDIPI contains two main phases (i) The offline phase, and (ii) The online phase. The algorithm operates on a set of interpretable features computed from the leaf images. The offline phase of the algorithm contains 4 main steps: i) image processing, ii) feature extraction, iii) train a algorithm. Figure 1 provides an overview of our algorithm. Figure 2 provides a selected set of features we use in the algorithm. The image processing steps are shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 1: Overview of MEDIPI algorithm\nFigure 2: Leaf image features\nFigure 3: Image processing workflow\nBenchmark dataset for plant leaves classification Researchers usually struggle and spend a lot of time establishing a database by gathering many leaf samples as raw data. By sharing our database we provide a training/test database to other researchers to develop new algorithms or to evaluate their algorithms. Furthermore, data sharing encourages more connections and collaboration between scientists, which leads to better decision-making.\nR Software Package MedLEA: Medicinal LEAf The MedLEA package provides two datasets.\ni) A dataset of morphological and structural features of 471 medicinal plant leaves. The features of each species are recorded by manually viewing the medicinal plant repository available at (http://www.instituteofayurveda.org/plants/). For more information visit at https://github.com/SMART-Research/MedLEA.\nFigure 4: Some morphological characteristics of profiles\nii) Leaf image data set: A database of leaf images of medicinal plants in Sri Lanka is not yet available. Hence, through this research, we establish a repository of medicinal plant images. This repository contains 1099 leaf images of 31 species. There are 29-45 images per species.\nFigure 5: Few samples from the MedLEA images\nYou can get access to the data set via the MedLEA package.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;MedLEA\u0026quot;) Research outputs Papers\nLakshika, J.

This process is challenging because certain forecasting techniques will perform best on some series while different alternative will perform best on other series. Certainly, each forecasting technique has its own territory and dominance. Discovering the conditions under which a forecasting technique will function well and under which not is useful in identifying model territory and dominance. The forecast submissions of the top 25 participants of the M4-competition are used for the analysis. Evaluating forecasting submission only using global measures such as forecasting error measure collapse all local information and does not allow to identify local differences of those methodologies. We explore the relationships between features of the methodologies used to generate forecasts, features of the resulting forecasts and features of the time series to identify model territories and their characteristics. Taking these local information into account can have benefit in developing new methods and shed some light for further development in the field of forecasting.\n","date":1624924800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624924800,"objectID":"9c1432c3f68785502b59cdd5ead41e3a","permalink":"/talk/isf21-talk/","publishdate":"2021-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/isf21-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"Abstract The field of time series forecasting has been evolving rapidly with advances in techniques for modelling and forecasting.

When creating scatterplots, how often do you fix the aspect ratio? #RStats #tidyverse #TidyTuesday #Python #ggplot2 — Thiyanga Talagala (@thiyangt) August 9, 2020    Aspect ratio The aspect ratio of a plot is the ratio of its height-to-width . The aspect ratio we choose for our graph plays a significant role. The graphs below plot exactly the same data points but they have different aspect ratios.\n The aspect-ratio of a plot can make an influence on the reader’s mind. Here is an example.

Think of Statistics as building blocks, and you need a solid foundation to move forward. Here, I explain five common terms in Statistics: i) Parameter, ii) Statistic, iii) Random Variable, iv) Estimator, v) Estimate and their notations.\nI will start with the definition of Population and Sample.\nA population is a complete collection of individuals/ objects that we are interested in. A sample is a subset of a population.\nParameter A parameter is a descriptive measure(numerical value) of the population. Parameters are usually denoted by Greek letters.\nExamples of parameters:\n \\(\\mu\\) - population mean\n  \\(\\sigma^2\\) - population variance\n  Statistic A statistic is a descriptive measure of a sample. For example, sample mean, sample standard deviation, etc. We will talk about the notations under estimator and estimate.\n Random Variable Before introducing random variable, let me very shortly recall what is a random experiment and what is a sample space.\nA random experiment is a physical situation whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty until it is observed. A random experiment can be repeated as many times as we want under the same conditions (leading to different outcomes). Each one of them a trial. Thus, a trial is a particular performance of a random experiment.\nA Sample space is a set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. In this blog post I use \\(\\Omega\\) to denote a sample space.\nExample 1:\nRandom Experiment: Tossing of a coin.\nSample Space: \\(\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}\\)\nlibrary(prob) tosscoin(1)  toss1 1 H 2 T Example 2:\nRandom Experiment: Toss a coin three times.\nSample Space: \\(\\Omega = \\{(H, H, H), (H, H, T), (H, T, H), (T, H, H), (H, T, T), (T, H, T), (T, T, H), (T, T, T)\\}\\)\ntosscoin(3)  toss1 toss2 toss3 1 H H H 2 T H H 3 H T H 4 T T H 5 H H T 6 T H T 7 H T T 8 T T T Definition: Random Variable\nLet \\((\\Omega, \\mathscr{F}, \\mathbb{P})\\) be a probability space. Random variable is a function \\(X: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(\\forall B \\in \\mathcal{B}( \\mathbb{R} ): X^{-1}(B) \\in \\mathscr{F}\\).\nYou need Measure Theory knowledge to understand the above definition.\nLoosely speaking a Random variable is a function from the sample space to the real numbers. There are two types of random variables: i) Discrete random variable and ii) Continuous random variable. We use Roman capital letters to denote random variables (\\(X\\), \\(Y\\), \\(Z\\), \\(U\\), \\(T\\), etc.). However, as soon as a variable \\(X\\) is observed, the observed values are represented by the corresponding simple Roman letter.\nThe notation \\(X(\\omega)\\) denotes the numerical value of the random variable X, when the outcome of the experiment is some particular \\(\\omega\\).\nAn example will help you to understand how this works. To start with, let’s consider a simple experiment with two possible outcomes: PCR test result of a randomly selected individual.\nThe random variable \\(X\\) can be defined as follows:\nSolution 1.1\nSample space\n\\[\\Omega = \\{Positive, Negative\\}\\]\nRandom variable\n\\[ X(\\omega)= \\begin{cases} 0,\u0026amp; \\text{if } \\omega = Negative\\\\ 1, \u0026amp; \\text{if } \\omega = Positive \\end{cases} \\]\nSolution 1.2\nSimply drop \\(\\omega\\) and define the random variable as follows:\n\\[ X= \\begin{cases} 0,\u0026amp; \\text{if the test result is negative. } \\\\ 1, \u0026amp; \\text{if the test result is positive.} \\end{cases} \\]\nLet’s consider another experiment. The experiment consists in selecting a random undergraduate student in the University during a period of one week, and measuring their height.\nThe random variable \\(Y\\) can be defined as follows:\n\\[\\Omega = \\{ \\omega: \\omega \u0026gt; 0\\}\\]\n\\[Y(\\omega) = \\omega, \\text{ } \\omega \\in \\Omega. \\]\nor\n\\[Y = \\text{Height in cm.}\\]\n Notations for Random Variables and Observed Data (in Sampling) Suppose you have a random variable \\(X\\). Suppose we repeat the random experiment \\(n\\) times. Then the resulting random variables are denoted by \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\). All \\(X_i\\)’s have the same distribution as \\(X\\). The random variables \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) are collectively referred to as a random sample.\nLet’s try to understand the concept with an example.\n\\[ X_i= \\begin{cases} 0,\u0026amp; \\text{if the test result of the } i^{th} \\text { is negaive } \\\\ 1, \u0026amp; \\text{if the test result of the } i^{th} \\text { is positive, } \\end{cases} \\]\nwhere \\(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\\)\nWe performed the PCR test on randomly selected 5 individuals. We called this sample 1. The results are \\(x_1=1, x_2=0, x_3=0, x_4=1, x_5=1\\).\nPrior to obtaining \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\), there is uncertainty about the values of each \\(x_i\\). Because of this uncertainty, before the results becomes available we view each observation as a random variable and denote the sample by \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5\\).\nWe again performed the PCR test on another randomly selected 5 individuals. We called this sample 2. Now results are \\(x_1=0, x_2=0, x_3=0, x_4=1, x_5=0\\).\nYou can see observable values for \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5\\) vary from sample to sample.\n Estimator and Estimate Distinction between the terms Estimator and Estimate is important.\nLet \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) be a random sample from a distribution function \\(f_X(x)\\) that depends on a unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\).\nAn estimator is a statistic, \\(T = f(X_1, ..., X_n)\\), that is used to estimate the unknown unknown parameter, \\(\\theta\\), based on an observed sample of \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\). The \\(t=f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\\) is an estimate of \\(\\theta\\).\nEstimator: An estimator is always a random variable.\n\\(\\hat{\\theta} = T = f(X_1, ..., X_n)\\)\nEstimate: An estimate is a constant.\n\\(\\hat{\\theta} = t = f(x_1, ..., x_n)\\)\nNote that we use \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) for both estimator and estimate.\nEstimator is a function of observable random variables that is used to estimate an unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\). The corresponding estimate is obtained by substituting the observed values to the estimator. You can also think of an estimator as the rule (equation) that is used to compute an estimate. For example, the sample mean, \\(\\bar{X}\\), is an estimator that is used to estimate the population mean, \\(\\mu\\).\nBelow example is useful to understand the concepts.\nLet’s say you wanted to know the mean height of undergraduates in a certain university with a population of 1000 undergraduates. You take a random sample of 10 students and measure their height. The observed values are (in cm) 150, 155, 160, 161, 162, 152, 140, 141, 150, 155. Suppose you want to use sample mean to estimate the population mean.\nThe parameter we want to estimate is, \\(\\mu\\), population mean (mean height of the students in the university.).\nThere are infinitely many possible estimators for \\(\\mu\\). For example, sample mean, sample median. In this example we use sample mean to estimate \\(\\mu\\). Now, let’s write the estimator using the notations.\nTo do this, we first define random variables \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, ..., X_{10}\\) as follows: \\(X_1\\) is the height of the \\(1^{st}\\) chosen person, \\(X_2\\) be the height of the \\(2^{nd}\\) chosen person,…. In general, \\(X_i\\) is the height of the \\(i^{th}\\) student chosen from the population.\nNow we can write the estimator as\n\\[\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{X}=\\frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + ... + X_{10}}{10}.\\]\nThe estimate is\n\\[\\hat{\\mu}=152.6\\text{ cm}.\\]\nmean(c(150, 155, 160, 161, 162, 152, 140, 141, 150, 155)) [1] 152.6 If you are not given the observed values of \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, ..., X_{10}\\), you can write the estimate as\n\\[\\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_{10}}{10}.\\]\nThe observed value of the estimator varies from sample to sample.\n Usage Writing distributions  \\[X \\sim Bin(10, 0.6)\\]\n\\[f_X(x) = P(X=x) = {10\\choose x} 0.6^x 0.4^{(10-x)}\\]\n\\[f_X(5) = P(X=5) = {10\\choose 5} 0.6^5 0.4^{(10-5)} = 0.37\\]\npbinom(5, 10, 0.6) [1] 0.3668967 Calculation of expectations  \\[E(\\text{Estimator}) = \\text{Parameter}\\]\n\\[E(\\bar{X}) = \\mu\\]\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\n ","date":1593820800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593820800,"objectID":"28af02174a7bbd23b46a22c223833d3c","permalink":"/post/statterms1/","publishdate":"2020-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/statterms1/","section":"post","summary":"The most common problem while learning Statistics is that students’ lack of understanding of the basic terminologies, notations, definitions and concepts.

Talagala, Hyndman \u0026amp; Athanasopoulos (2018) proposed a classification framework, called FFORMS (Feature-based FORecast Model Selection), which selects forecast models based on features calculated from the time series. The FFORMS framework builds a mapping that relates the features of a time series to the “best” forecast model using the random forest algorithm. In this paper we explore what is happening under the hood of the FFORMS framework and thereby gain an understanding of what features lead to the different choices of forecast models and how different features influence the predicted outcome. This is accomplished using model-agnostic machine learning interpretability approaches. Partial-dependency plots are used to visualize both main and interaction effects of features. The results of this study provide a valuable insight into how different features and their interactions affect the choice of forecast model selection. This gives a more refined picture of the relationship between features and the choice of forecast model which is particularly valuable for ongoing research in the field of feature-based time series analysis.\nKeywords: forecasting, time series, machine learning interpretability, black-box models, LIME\nReferences Talagala, TS, RJ Hyndman \u0026amp; G Athanasopoulos (2018).

The proposed framework has been evaluated using time series from the M1 and M3 competitions, and is shown to yield accurate forecasts comparable to several benchmarks and other commonly used automated approaches of time series forecasting.","tags":null,"title":"Meta-learning how to forecast time series","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1518393600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518393600,"objectID":"99fad8d2730a91524d4a348202ea3b47","permalink":"/talk/japan18-talk/","publishdate":"2018-02-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/japan18-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Analysing large collections of time series","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nMany applications require a large number of time series to be forecast.

However, large scale time series data present numerous challenges in modelling and implementation due to the high dimensionality. It is unlikely that a single method will consistently provides better forecasts across all time series. On the other hand, selecting individual forecast models when the number of series is very large can be extremely challenging. In this paper we propose a classification framework which selects forecast models based on features calculated from the time series. A Random Forest approach is used to develop the classifier. The proposed framework is tested using the M3 data and is compared against several benchmarks and other commonly used approaches of forecasting.\n","date":1498435200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498435200,"objectID":"e9693cefbfbe4b5fc9d03b6ee5b201ff","permalink":"/talk/isf17-talk/","publishdate":"2017-06-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/isf17-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"Abstract\nMany applications require a large number of time series to be forecast.
