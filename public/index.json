To mark this day, I recreated Florence Nightingale’s famous Coxcomb chart using R programming with hashtag#tidyverse mainly using hashtag#tidyr hashtag#dplyr and hashtag#ggplot2. It was one of the earliest and most powerful examples of data visualization influencing public policy.\nNightingale was not only a nurse but also a statistician. At a time when women had limited access to science, she used data to demonstrate that more soldiers were dying from preventable diseases than from battle wounds during the Crimean War. Her visualization changed healthcare policy. This plot is a reminder that:\n• Data is powerful when communicated clearly.\n• Visualization is not just decoration. It is evidence.\n• Science needs more women and more visible role models.\n#rprogramming #InternationalDayOfWomenAndGirlsInScience #WomenInScience #FlorenceNightingale #DataVisualization #WomenInSTEM #GirlsInScience #OWSD\n## Packages library(tidyverse) library(HistData) ## Data data(\u0026#34;Nightingale\u0026#34;) glimpse(Nightingale) ## Rows: 24\r## Columns: 10\r## $ Date \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; 1854-04-01, 1854-05-01, 1854-06-01, 1854-07-01, 1854-08-…\r## $ Month \u0026lt;ord\u0026gt; Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb, Ma…\r## $ Year \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 1854, 1854, 1854, 1854, 1854, 1854, 1854, 1854, 1854, 185…\r## $ Army \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 8571, 23333, 28333, 28722, 30246, 30290, 30643, 29736, 32…\r## $ Disease \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 1, 12, 11, 359, 828, 788, 503, 844, 1725, 2761, 2120, 120…\r## $ Wounds \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 81, 132, 287, 114, 83, 42, 32, 48, 49, 209…\r## $ Other \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 5, 9, 6, 23, 30, 70, 128, 106, 131, 324, 361, 172, 57, 37…\r## $ Disease.rate \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 1.4, 6.2, 4.7, 150.0, 328.5, 312.2, 197.0, 340.6, 631.5, …\r## $ Wounds.rate \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 32.1, 51.7, 115.8, 41.7, 30.7, 1…\r## $ Other.rate \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 7.0, 4.6, 2.5, 9.6, 11.9, 27.7, 50.1, 42.8, 48.0, 120.0, … ## Data Pre-processing and Plotting Nightingale |\u0026gt; select(Date, Month, Year, contains(\u0026#34;rate\u0026#34;)) |\u0026gt; pivot_longer(cols = 4:6, names_to = \u0026#34;Cause\u0026#34;, values_to = \u0026#34;Rate\u0026#34;)|\u0026gt; mutate(Cause = gsub(\u0026#34;.rate\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, Cause), period = ifelse(Date \u0026lt;= as.Date(\u0026#34;1855-03-01\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;APRIL 1854 TO MARCH 1855\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;APRIL 1855 TO MARCH 1856\u0026#34;), Month = fct_relevel(Month, \u0026#34;Jul\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Aug\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Sep\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Oct\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Nov\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Dec\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Jan\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Feb\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Mar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Apr\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;May\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Jun\u0026#34;))|\u0026gt; ggplot(aes(x=Month, y=Rate, fill=Cause)) + geom_col(width=1, alpha=0.5) + coord_equal(ratio = 1) + coord_polar() + facet_wrap(~period) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\u0026#34;skyblue3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;grey30\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#fb9a99\u0026#34;)) + scale_y_sqrt() + theme_bw() + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), strip.text = element_text(size = 11), legend.position = \u0026#34;bottom\u0026#34;, plot.margin = unit(c(10, 10, 10, 10), \u0026#34;pt\u0026#34;), plot.title = element_text(vjust = 5)) ","date":1770768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1770768000,"objectID":"477fd9901df6dc80441d26fd3a444751","permalink":"https://thiyanga.netlify.app/post/blog/","publishdate":"2026-02-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/blog/","section":"post","summary":"February 11, is recognized globally as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.","tags":["R","ggplot2"],"title":"Recreating Nightingale's most famous diagram, known as the Coxcomb","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rWhen I first heard about the OWSD “Short Talk, Big Impact” competition, I knew it was not going to be just another presentation. I had only 180 seconds to communicate years of research, spark curiosity, and leave a lasting impression.\nMy talk was titled “Exploring Artistic Legacy: Analyzing Artifact Differences Across Kingdoms Using Machine Learning.” It reflected my dual identity as both a data scientist and an artist, and my passion for discovering the mathematical beauty hidden within our cultural artifacts.\nBefore the Event OWSD made the process incredibly organized. The OWSD team guided us with great care. We received detailed information about the event, the judging criteria, and even examples of successful short talks to learn from. These resources helped me understand what makes a talk memorable in such a short span of time. The organizers also walked us through how the competition would unfold; from the time limits to the technical arrangements. That helped calm my nerves a bit, because I knew what to expect.\nPlanning My Talk My research topic is quite complex, and simplifying it into something engaging was a challenge in itself. I didn’t want to oversimplify the science, but I also didn’t want to lose the audience in technical jargon. So, I planned my talk using a simple but powerful technique: I started with something familiar (a concept that anyone could relate to) and gradually led the audience into the heart of my work.\nStrategy 1\nI began with something familiar, the worlds of art and data science, and drew parallels between the two.\n“Artists see patterns in shapes. Data scientists see patterns in data. They both tell stories about the world.”\nFrom there, I gently led the audience toward the unknown — the idea that machine learning can uncover mathematical concepts embedded in historical artifacts. This transition helped the audience travel with me, step by step, from everyday understanding to a new and thought-provoking perspective.\nStrategy 2\nI also used visuals strategically. A well-designed image can say what fifty words cannot. Each visual was chosen carefully to support my message, not distract from it. For example, I used visuals of ancient murals and artifacts to illustrate how geometry, tessellation, and symmetry reveal the deep mathematical roots of our artistic heritage.\nStrategy 3\nThe environment was another thing I paid close attention to. The day of my talk coincided with World Mathematics Day, and this year’s theme was “Mathematics, Art, and Creativity.” It aligned perfectly with my topic, and I used that to my advantage by showing. It helped create a meaningful connection with the occasion and made my talk feel timely and relevant.\nFurthermore, I also set up my background to match the theme of my talk. I arranged my room with artistic elements that reflected both mathematics and creativity, creating an environment that visually supported my message and helped the audience feel the connection between art, science, and culture.\nStrategy 4\nAnd one thing I never did: memorize by heart. I’ve learned that when you memorize, you lose the natural rhythm of speaking. Instead, I practiced enough to know my key points and let the rest flow naturally. That way, my words sounded genuine and spontaneous, not rehearsed.\nWhat I Learned This experience taught me that clarity is more powerful than complexity. If your audience can understand and remember one key message, you’ve succeeded. It also reminded me of the importance of storytelling in science.\nI also realized that the impact of a short talk doesn’t end when the timer stops. The feedback I received afterward from people who said my talk helped them see my research differently was truly rewarding.\nThe Impact The response to my talk was heartwarming. Many told me they had never thought of mathematics and art as connected before. Some said the talk made them curious about the patterns hidden in culture and that curiosity, I believe, is the true success of any scientific communication.\nThe lessons I learned from the competition have become an integral part of my teaching. I now incorporate them into my Scientific Writing and Communication and Essential Skills in Statistics course units when teaching undergraduate and postgraduate students in the fields of Statistics, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence. I have also been invited by several organizations to conduct training sessions on effective scientific communication and data storytelling.\nFurthermore, this experience has also given me a platform to give a voice to our proud artifacts and historical paintings in Sri Lanka, highlighting the mathematical concepts rooted within them and how technology can help preserve and celebrate this heritage on a global stage.\nParticipating in the OWSD competition gave me more than just a platform. I learned how to distill my ideas, how to communicate science with heart, and how to make every second count.\nThank you A huge thank you to Erin Johnson and Giulia Signori of the OWSD Secretariat. They highlighted the positive aspects of each talk and appreciated the valuable messages shared with the audience. The way they organized the event was also an excellent learning experience for us, providing insights into effective event planning and audience engagement.\nA big shout-out to UNESCO-OWSD and The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) for providing this valuable opportunity by organizing such an impactful event.\nMy 180 seconds might have been short, but the impact it created will stay with me for a long time.

Providing better forecasts for these time series is important in decision and policy making. However, large scale time series data present numerous challenges in modelling and implementation due to the high dimensionality. It is unlikely that a single method will consistently provide better forecasts across all time series. On the other hand, selecting individual forecast models when the number of series is very large can be extremely challenging. In this talk, I will present a general framework for forecast model selection using meta-learning. We call this framework FFORMS (Feature-based FORecast Model Selection). The underlying approach involves computing a vector of features from the time series which are then used to select the forecasting model. The model selection process is carried out using a classification algorithm – we use the time series features as inputs, and the best forecasting algorithm as the output. Furthermore, we explore what is happening under the hood of the FFORMS framework and thereby gain an understanding of what features lead to the different choices of forecast models and how different features influence the predicted outcome. The proposed algorithm is implemented in the R package seer, which is available on CRAN at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=seer.\nSeer package: https://github.com/thiyangt/seer\n","date":1639094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639094400,"objectID":"5d571a41de6ab39a8e53d22c5cfa933d","permalink":"https://thiyanga.netlify.app/talk/whyr-talk/","publishdate":"2021-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/whyr-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"The Why R?

The other method of recognizing these plants involves Laboratory- based testing, which requires trained skills, data interpretation which is costly and time-intensive. Automatic ways to identify medicinal plants are useful especially for those that are lacking experience in herbal recognition. We introduce a computationally efficient new algorithm for medicinal plant classification. We refer to our medicinal plant classification algorithm as MEDIPI : MEDIicinal Plant Identification. MEDIPI contains two main phases (i) The offline phase, and (ii) The online phase. The algorithm operates on a set of interpretable features computed from the leaf images. The offline phase of the algorithm contains 4 main steps: i) image processing, ii) feature extraction, iii) train a algorithm. Figure 1 provides an overview of our algorithm. Figure 2 provides a selected set of features we use in the algorithm. The image processing steps are shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 1: Overview of MEDIPI algorithm\nFigure 2: Leaf image features\nFigure 3: Image processing workflow\nBenchmark dataset for plant leaves classification Researchers usually struggle and spend a lot of time establishing a database by gathering many leaf samples as raw data. By sharing our database we provide a training/test database to other researchers to develop new algorithms or to evaluate their algorithms. Furthermore, data sharing encourages more connections and collaboration between scientists, which leads to better decision-making.\nR Software Package MedLEA: Medicinal LEAf The MedLEA package provides two datasets.\ni) A dataset of morphological and structural features of 471 medicinal plant leaves. The features of each species are recorded by manually viewing the medicinal plant repository available at (http://www.instituteofayurveda.org/plants/). For more information visit at https://github.com/SMART-Research/MedLEA.\nFigure 4: Some morphological characteristics of profiles\nii) Leaf image data set: A database of leaf images of medicinal plants in Sri Lanka is not yet available. Hence, through this research, we establish a repository of medicinal plant images. This repository contains 1099 leaf images of 31 species. There are 29-45 images per species.\nFigure 5: Few samples from the MedLEA images\nYou can get access to the data set via the MedLEA package.\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;MedLEA\u0026#34;) Research outputs Papers\nLakshika, J.

Discovering the conditions under which a forecasting technique will function well and under which not is useful in identifying model territory and dominance. The forecast submissions of the top 25 participants of the M4-competition are used for the analysis. Evaluating forecasting submission only using global measures such as forecasting error measure collapse all local information and does not allow to identify local differences of those methodologies. We explore the relationships between features of the methodologies used to generate forecasts, features of the resulting forecasts and features of the time series to identify model territories and their characteristics.

Think of Statistics as building blocks, and you need a solid foundation to move forward. Here, I explain five common terms in Statistics: i) Parameter, ii) Statistic, iii) Random Variable, iv) Estimator, v) Estimate and their notations.\nI will start with the definition of Population and Sample.\nA population is a complete collection of individuals/ objects that we are interested in. A sample is a subset of a population.\nParameter\rA parameter is a descriptive measure(numerical value) of the population. Parameters are usually denoted by Greek letters.\nExamples of parameters:\n\\(\\mu\\) - population mean\n\\(\\sigma^2\\) - population variance\nStatistic\rA statistic is a descriptive measure of a sample. For example, sample mean, sample standard deviation, etc. We will talk about the notations under estimator and estimate.\nRandom Variable\rBefore introducing random variable, let me very shortly recall what is a random experiment and what is a sample space.\nA random experiment is a physical situation whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty until it is observed. A random experiment can be repeated as many times as we want under the same conditions (leading to different outcomes). Each one of them a trial. Thus, a trial is a particular performance of a random experiment.\nA Sample space is a set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. In this blog post I use \\(\\Omega\\) to denote a sample space.\nExample 1:\nRandom Experiment: Tossing of a coin.\nSample Space: \\(\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}\\)\nlibrary(prob) tosscoin(1)\rtoss1\r1 H\r2 T\rExample 2:\nRandom Experiment: Toss a coin three times.\nSample Space: \\(\\Omega = \\{(H, H, H), (H, H, T), (H, T, H), (T, H, H), (H, T, T), (T, H, T), (T, T, H), (T, T, T)\\}\\)\ntosscoin(3)\rtoss1 toss2 toss3\r1 H H H\r2 T H H\r3 H T H\r4 T T H\r5 H H T\r6 T H T\r7 H T T\r8 T T T\rDefinition: Random Variable\nLet \\((\\Omega, \\mathscr{F}, \\mathbb{P})\\) be a probability space. Random variable is a function \\(X: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(\\forall B \\in \\mathcal{B}( \\mathbb{R} ): X^{-1}(B) \\in \\mathscr{F}\\).\nYou need Measure Theory knowledge to understand the above definition.\nLoosely speaking a Random variable is a function from the sample space to the real numbers. There are two types of random variables: i) Discrete random variable and ii) Continuous random variable. We use Roman capital letters to denote random variables (\\(X\\), \\(Y\\), \\(Z\\), \\(U\\), \\(T\\), etc.). However, as soon as a variable \\(X\\) is observed, the observed values are represented by the corresponding simple Roman letter.\nThe notation \\(X(\\omega)\\) denotes the numerical value of the random variable X, when the outcome of the experiment is some particular \\(\\omega\\).\nAn example will help you to understand how this works. To start with, let’s consider a simple experiment with two possible outcomes: PCR test result of a randomly selected individual.\nThe random variable \\(X\\) can be defined as follows:\nSolution 1.1\nSample space\n\\[\\Omega = \\{Positive, Negative\\}\\]\nRandom variable\n\\[\rX(\\omega)= \\begin{cases}\r0,\u0026amp; \\text{if } \\omega = Negative\\\\\r1, \u0026amp; \\text{if } \\omega = Positive\r\\end{cases}\r\\]\nSolution 1.2\nSimply drop \\(\\omega\\) and define the random variable as follows:\n\\[\rX= \\begin{cases}\r0,\u0026amp; \\text{if the test result is negative. } \\\\\r1, \u0026amp; \\text{if the test result is positive.}\r\\end{cases}\r\\]\nLet’s consider another experiment. The experiment consists in selecting a random undergraduate student in the University during a period of one week, and measuring their height.\nThe random variable \\(Y\\) can be defined as follows:\n\\[\\Omega = \\{ \\omega: \\omega \u0026gt; 0\\}\\]\n\\[Y(\\omega) = \\omega, \\text{ } \\omega \\in \\Omega. \\]\nor\n\\[Y = \\text{Height in cm.}\\]\nNotations for Random Variables and Observed Data (in Sampling)\rSuppose you have a random variable \\(X\\). Suppose we repeat the random experiment \\(n\\) times. Then the resulting random variables are denoted by \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\). All \\(X_i\\)’s have the same distribution as \\(X\\). The random variables \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) are collectively referred to as a random sample.\nLet’s try to understand the concept with an example.\n\\[\rX_i= \\begin{cases}\r0,\u0026amp; \\text{if the test result of the } i^{th} \\text { is negaive } \\\\\r1, \u0026amp; \\text{if the test result of the } i^{th} \\text { is positive, }\r\\end{cases}\r\\]\nwhere \\(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\\)\nWe performed the PCR test on randomly selected 5 individuals. We called this sample 1. The results are \\(x_1=1, x_2=0, x_3=0, x_4=1, x_5=1\\).\nPrior to obtaining \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\), there is uncertainty about the values of each \\(x_i\\). Because of this\runcertainty, before the results becomes available we view each observation as a random\rvariable and denote the sample by \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5\\).\nWe again performed the PCR test on another randomly selected 5 individuals. We called this sample 2. Now results are \\(x_1=0, x_2=0, x_3=0, x_4=1, x_5=0\\).\nYou can see observable values for \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5\\) vary from sample to sample.\nEstimator and Estimate\rDistinction between the terms Estimator and Estimate is important.\nLet \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\\) be a random sample from a distribution function \\(f_X(x)\\) that depends on a unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\).\nAn estimator is a statistic, \\(T = f(X_1, ..., X_n)\\), that is used to estimate the unknown unknown parameter, \\(\\theta\\), based on an observed sample of \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\). The \\(t=f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\\) is an estimate of \\(\\theta\\).\nEstimator: An estimator is always a random variable.\n\\(\\hat{\\theta} = T = f(X_1, ..., X_n)\\)\nEstimate: An estimate is a constant.\n\\(\\hat{\\theta} = t = f(x_1, ..., x_n)\\)\nNote that we use \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) for both estimator and estimate.\nEstimator is a function of observable random variables that is used to estimate an unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\). The corresponding estimate is obtained by substituting the observed values to the estimator. You can also think of an estimator as the rule (equation) that is used to compute an estimate. For example, the sample mean, \\(\\bar{X}\\), is an estimator that is used to estimate the population mean, \\(\\mu\\).\nBelow example is useful to understand the concepts.\nLet’s say you wanted to know the mean height of undergraduates in a certain university with a population of 1000 undergraduates. You take a random sample of 10 students and measure their height. The observed values are (in cm) 150, 155, 160, 161, 162, 152, 140, 141, 150, 155. Suppose you want to use sample mean to estimate the population mean.\nThe parameter we want to estimate is, \\(\\mu\\), population mean (mean height of the students in the university.).\nThere are infinitely many possible estimators for \\(\\mu\\). For example, sample mean, sample median. In this example we use sample mean to estimate \\(\\mu\\). Now, let’s write the estimator using the notations.\nTo do this, we first define random variables \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, ..., X_{10}\\) as follows: \\(X_1\\) is the height of the \\(1^{st}\\) chosen person, \\(X_2\\) be the height of the \\(2^{nd}\\) chosen person,…. In general, \\(X_i\\) is the height of the \\(i^{th}\\) student chosen from the population.\nNow we can write the estimator as\n\\[\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{X}=\\frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + ... + X_{10}}{10}.\\]\nThe estimate is\n\\[\\hat{\\mu}=152.6\\text{ cm}.\\]\nmean(c(150, 155, 160, 161, 162, 152, 140, 141, 150, 155))\r[1] 152.6\rIf you are not given the observed values of \\(X_1, X_2, X_3, ..., X_{10}\\), you can write the estimate as\n\\[\\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_{10}}{10}.\\]\nThe observed value of the estimator varies from sample to sample.\nUsage\rWriting distributions\r\\[X \\sim Bin(10, 0.6)\\]\n\\[f_X(x) = P(X=x) = {10\\choose x} 0.6^x 0.4^{(10-x)}\\]\n\\[f_X(5) = P(X=5) = {10\\choose 5} 0.6^5 0.4^{(10-5)} = 0.37\\]\npbinom(5, 10, 0.6)\r[1] 0.3668967\rCalculation of expectations\r\\[E(\\text{Estimator}) = \\text{Parameter}\\]\n\\[E(\\bar{X}) = \\mu\\]\nThis work is\rlicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\rLicense.\n","date":1593820800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593820800,"objectID":"28af02174a7bbd23b46a22c223833d3c","permalink":"https://thiyanga.netlify.app/post/statterms1/","publishdate":"2020-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/statterms1/","section":"post","summary":"The most common problem while learning Statistics is that students’ lack of understanding of the basic terminologies, notations, definitions and concepts.

This study was conducted to evaluate the consumers\u0026rsquo; level of knowledge and use of information provided on food labels in making purchasing decisions. A structured questionnaire-based survey was used for the purpose of the study. This is a cross sectional study done over a period of five months from October, 2010 to March, 2011 with an average of seven interviews being conducted each week. The survey was conducted at supermarkets, retail shops of various sizes in five towns: Colombo 02, Kottawa, Maharagama, Nugegoda and Horana in Sri Lanka. A total of 586 respondents were considered for the study. The dataset and the questionnaire used in this studey can be downloaded from the following links.

Talagala, Hyndman \u0026amp; Athanasopoulos (2018) proposed a classification framework, called FFORMS (Feature-based FORecast Model Selection), which selects forecast models based on features calculated from the time series. The FFORMS framework builds a mapping that relates the features of a time series to the “best” forecast model using the random forest algorithm. In this paper we explore what is happening under the hood of the FFORMS framework and thereby gain an understanding of what features lead to the different choices of forecast models and how different features influence the predicted outcome. This is accomplished using model-agnostic machine learning interpretability approaches. Partial-dependency plots are used to visualize both main and interaction effects of features. The results of this study provide a valuable insight into how different features and their interactions affect the choice of forecast model selection. This gives a more refined picture of the relationship between features and the choice of forecast model which is particularly valuable for ongoing research in the field of feature-based time series analysis.\nKeywords: forecasting, time series, machine learning interpretability, black-box models, LIME\nReferences Talagala, TS, RJ Hyndman \u0026amp; G Athanasopoulos (2018).
