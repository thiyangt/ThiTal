I created [this blog](https://thiyanga-spatiotemporal.netlify.app/) using Quarto. Here are the steps that I used to create the blog.

## Step 1

Install Quarto. Follow the instructions in [this](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) tutorial.

On R Console install Quarto using the command

```r
install.packages(quarto)
```

## Step 2

Create a git hub repository and create a RStudio project.

## Step 3

The type the following command in the RStudio terminal

```r
quarto create-project myblog --type website:blog
```

This will create a folder called `myblog` with the following documents inside.

<img src="/post/quarto.PNG" alt="final image" width="400"/>



Copy all the documents inside the folder into your project folder, and delete the `myblog` folder.

## Step 4

Rename `index.qmd` to `blog.qmd` and rename `about.qmd` to `index.qmd`.

## Step 5

Include your details to `_quarto.yml`.

## Step 6

Click `Render` button to preview the blog.

To preview the website in the current directory type the following command in the terminal

```r
quarto preview
```

## Step 7

To publish the blog with Netlify, type the following command.

```r
quarto publish netlify
```
