## Abstract

The goal of denguedatahub is to provide the research community with a unified dataset by collecting worldwide dengue-related data, merged with exogenous variables helpful for a better understanding of the spread of dengue and the reproducibility of research. By making our data freely available to the research community, Dengue Data Hub is committed to promoting open science and reproducibility. We believe that by centralizing high-quality data, we can facilitate collaborative research and accelerate progress toward a better understanding of dengue fever. The data can be easily accessed using our open-source R software package, denguedatahub.
